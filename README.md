# Pure Prolog Language Support

A VS Code Extension for Prolog, leveraging a [pure Prolog language server](https://github.com/hargettp/prolog_lsp).

Currently this extension supports (SWI-Prolog)[https://swi-prolog.org], and may leverage features native to that implementation. Pull requests are welcome for those that wish to adapt it to support other Prolog implementations.

Currently supports the following features, both for the current project source, system libraries, and any installed [packages](https://www.swi-prolog.org/pack/list).

* Document symbols
* Workspace symbols
* Hover info
* Go To Reference / Find All References
* Go To Definition(s)
* Auto-completion
